# First-project- 
My code consist of this stages:
1. Ask the user for three points located in the xy-plane as (x1, y1),
(x2, y2) and (x3, y3).
2. Check if these three points form a triangle.
3. If it does not form a triangle, print this message on the screen;
”The given points do not form triangles. Please enter new points.”
4. If the given three points form a triangle, write this message on
the screen; ”Triangle1 is created with (x1, y1), (x2, y2) and (x3, y3)
points.”
5. Repeat this process to form three triangles as Triangle1, Trian￾gle2, Triangle3.
6. If three triangles are formed, ask the user for another point on
the xy-plane.
7. Check if the new point is inside these triangles formed previously
given points.
8. If outside, print to screen; ”The given point is not inside these
triangles.”
9. If the given point is in the Triangle1, print to screen; ”The given
point is inside the Triangle1.”

10. If the given point is in the Triangle2, print to screen; ”The given
point is inside the Triangle2.”
11. If the given point is in the Triangle3, print to screen; ”The given
point is inside the Triangle3
